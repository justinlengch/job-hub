SCHEMA:
{
"intent": "<INTENT>",
"company": "...",
"role": "...",
"status": "<STATUS>",
"event_type": null,
"event_description": null,
"event_date": null,
"location": null,
"salary_range": null,
"notes": null
}

RULES:
- intent: Always required, classify the email purpose, NEW_APPLICATION is for application received/submitted emails, APPLICATION_EVENT is for details indicating a change to job application status that fits into categories defined in EVENT_TYPE enum. Use GENERAL if unclear or email is not job application related.
- company: Extract company name, use null if unclear
- role: Extract the job title/position only; keep relevant scope/discipline when attached with a hyphen or colon (e.g., "Backend Software Engineer - Data Safety and Compliance"). Remove unrelated qualifiers and any parenthetical/bracketed content that is not part of the title. Use null if unclear.
  - Keep examples:
    - "Backend Software Engineer - Data Safety and Compliance" → "Backend Software Engineer - Data Safety and Compliance"
    - "Full Stack Developer - SAP Build Mobile and AI" → "Full Stack Developer - SAP Build Mobile and AI"
  - Strip examples:
    - "Junior Application Developer (Fresh grads welcomed)" → "Junior Application Developer"
    - "Software Engineer (New Grad)" → "Software Engineer"
    - "Data Analyst (Immediate Start)" → "Data Analyst"
  - Do NOT include: company name, team/department branding, location, employment type (full-time/contract), timeframes (Summer 2025), benefits, eligibility notes, or marketing text.
- status: Map to the closest state using these examples:
  - APPLIED: submission/receipt acknowledgements; "thank you for applying"; "your application has been received"
  - ASSESSMENT: invitation/received/instructions for assessments; "complete an assessment", "online test", "coding challenge", "take-home assignment", "HackerRank/Codility" links
  - INTERVIEW: interview invitation, scheduling/rescheduling, confirmation, or recap; "schedule an interview", "interview confirmed"
  - REJECTED: "regret to inform", "not moving forward", "application rejected"
  - OFFERED: offer extended, "offer letter"
  - ACCEPTED: acceptance confirmed
  - WITHDRAWN: applicant withdrew their application
  - Precedence: if any assessment is referenced, choose ASSESSMENT even if the email also says "thank you for applying".
  - Default: if no status cues exist, use APPLIED.
- event_type: Set only when intent is APPLICATION_EVENT. Map using these examples:
  - APPLICATION_RECEIVED: confirmation that your application was submitted/received (use for follow-ups beyond the initial APPLIED acknowledgement).
  - APPLICATION_VIEWED: employer viewed/opened your application/profile.
  - APPLICATION_REVIEWED: application moved to review; "under review", "screening", "shortlisted".
  - ASSESSMENT_RECEIVED: invitation/links/instructions to complete an assessment or assignment.
  - ASSESSMENT_COMPLETED: confirmation or notice that your assessment was completed/received or results acknowledged.
  - INTERVIEW_SCHEDULED: invitation to schedule or confirmed interview with date/time (calendar invites, scheduling links).
  - INTERVIEW_COMPLETED: interview completed/thank-you notes; "we'll be in touch."
  - REFERENCE_REQUESTED: request to provide references or initiate background checks.
  - OFFER_RECEIVED: offer extended or offer letter attached.
  - OFFER_ACCEPTED: acceptance of the offer confirmed.
  - OFFER_DECLINED: candidate declined the offer.
  - APPLICATION_REJECTED: decision not moving forward.
  - APPLICATION_WITHDRAWN: application withdrawn/canceled (by candidate or system).
  - Precedence: if assessment invite language is present, prefer ASSESSMENT_RECEIVED over APPLICATION_SUBMITTED; if interview scheduling and general review both appear, prefer INTERVIEW_SCHEDULED.
- event_description: Brief description of the event if applicable
- event_date: ISO format date if mentioned, otherwise null
- location: Job location if mentioned, otherwise null
- salary_range: Salary info if mentioned, otherwise null
- notes: Any additional relevant information, otherwise null
- ignore_boilerplate: Ignore navigation bars, headers/footers, unsubscribe links, confidentiality/legal notices, social media/link hubs, tracking pixels/images, banners, and general marketing content.
- quoted_replies: If the email contains quoted previous messages or long threads, analyze only the most recent message, unless the latest content is a forwarding wrapper with no substance.
- html_guidance: Treat the plain text ($body_text) as authoritative. Consult the HTML section only to recover structure (tables, labeled fields) or details missing from the text. Do not rely on CSS, attributes, or scripts—extract semantic content only.
- sections_priority: Prioritize content that indicates application submitted/received, interview scheduling/results, assessments (received/completed), or offer/decision language; extract dates/times if present.
- links_and_attachments: Do not follow links. Only extract information explicitly stated in the email body; mention attachments only if they are explicitly described.
